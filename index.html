            <p>A software development project is a complex undertaking by two or more persons within the boundaries of time, budget, and staff resources that produces new or enhanced computer code that adds significant business value to a new or existing business process.

                Although this is a restrictive definition, it does define the types of software development projects that are addressed in this book. The criteria for these projects are that they have the potential of adding significant business value and are not trivial undertakings. These development projects will have significant business value, be highly visible, be of moderate to high complexity, and were needed yesterday. Several types of software development projects are within the scope of this book. They range from repeatable projects that have been done many times before to projects that are cutting edge problem solving projects. Each presents its own special challenge to the developer. The example given below will be the staging area for exploring effective approaches to software development project management. I’ve crafted a hypothetical case study that will be a referent as I apply the SDPM strategies presented in this book. I hope that this will help you further align yourself with using the models and approaches that this book addresses. I’ll incorporate more details to the case study as needed.</p> </div>
